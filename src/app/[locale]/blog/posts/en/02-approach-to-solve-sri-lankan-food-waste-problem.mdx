Despite being an agricultural nation, Sri Lanka faces persistent challenges in its fresh produce
supply chain. Consumers encounter recurring issues such as vegetable scarcity, sudden price
hikes for certain vegetable items, low quality vegetables and fruits, etc.
On the other hand farmers face significant challenges, including crop loss due to climate
changes, market fluctuations leading to unsold produce, coupled with insufficient return on
investment in seeds and fertilizers [Tons of produce and food dumped every day](https://www.sundaytimes.lk/230409/news/tons-of-produce-and-food-dumped-every-day-516721.html) . Additionally, the situation worsened for farmers
cultivating on rented land.

According to previous research over 40% of fruits and 30% of vegetables turns into
waste throughout the supply chain which consist of three stages such as farm-gate to collector,
collector to wholesaler, wholesaler to retailer. In 2023, Minister of
agriculture stated that 221,955 metric tons of vegetables and 290,151 metric tons of fruits
wasted annually during transportation in Sri Lanka. Fluctuations in market prices are
identified as a root cause for these issues. Intermediaries exploit these price variations,
potentially leaving farmers in debt. The following figures illustrate the monthly price
fluctuations of five commonly used produce items.

## Solution:

This information driven business proposition addresses challenges faced by farmers,
hotels and retailers within the agricultural supply chain. By leveraging digital transformation,
the business model aims to achieve 100% demand forecasting accuracy, by focusing on the
entire production cycle from seed to fork.

This business model utilizes historical data analysis to predict fruits and vegetables
demand of contracted business for upcoming months. By comparing
predicted demand with existing contracted farmer's crops, the system identifies potential
shortages and recommends additional crops for farmers trying to start a new harvest cycle. This
approach helps to reduce food wastage and price fluctuation by ensuring planted crops of
farmers align with market needs.
To further optimize outcomes, the system incorporates farmer-submitted data points
such as soil PH, water availability, weather forecasts and humidity.
Finally by eliminating three intermediaries in the supply chain, the system connects
farmers directly with hotel and retail shops. This reduction allows for lower prices for buyers
and higher return for farmers, creating a win-win situation for stakeholders.
Due to initial resource constraints, the venture will initially utilize a third-party logistics
provider for deliveries. The core strategy involves employing two distinct interfaces: one

catering to buyers and another serving farmers. This platform aims to facilitate efficient
transactions while fostering a closed-loop system.

## Value addition:

Traditional processes often suffer from complexity and unnecessary intermediaries,
contributing to waste and price fluctuations. â€œHellofresh" leverages backend service built on top cloud infrastructure which gives oppurtunity to use pre-trained model to make more accurate predictionss to reduce the costs, offering competitive prices.
Additionally the system will utilize user-friendly interfaces and dedicated customer
support, ensuring a seamless user experience for both farmers and
consumers.
The long term vision involves integrating blockchain technology within the next
decade. This integration will enhance supply chain transparency, providing all stakeholders
with greater visibility and trust.

## Revenue strategy:

The proposed business utilizes a freemium model approach to attract and reatin
customers as a start up business. Additionally, it combines a profit margin
pricing strategy for non-essential products while giving competive pricing for essential goods
such as tomatoes and green chillies, etc.
A crucial challenge identified concerns the potenial for user to bypass the platform by
directly connecting with farmers and buyers if the profit margin is choosed as the primary
revenue model. This could disrupt the business model and
hinder the achievement of a low-cost startegy, essential for startups seeking market share and
customer acquisition.

#### Target Market:

Hotels and retail shop owners are the primary target market. Farmers will be taken in
to consideration as Secondary target market since they actively engage and gain benefits from
the final solution. Inorder to ensure food safety and multi-level traceability both
buyers and farmers are bound to the system in a e-contract model.

#### Values: 

1. Provide fresh and quality products to customers
2. Use technology to endure food security in sri lanka food ecosystem
3. Promote sustainable farming practices

#### Vision:

To empower sri lankan farmers to develop by integrating traditional methods with modern
technologies to provide best return for their produce to make them financially stable.

#### Mission:
To connect farmers directly with end-customers to give best price to farmers and best products
to consumers and reduce food wastage and unnecessary resource wastage
